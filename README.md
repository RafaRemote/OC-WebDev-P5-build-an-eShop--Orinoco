# OpenClassrooms / Web Developer Path

## Project number 5: Build an e-commerce site in JavaScript

Skills:

- interact with web services with JavaScript
- handle JavaScript events
- validate data from external sources
- create test plan for an application

Instructions:

- Clone this repository in your code editor.
- Open the page 'index.html' in your browser: you got the message that something went wrong. This is normal as this repo is only about the frontend part of the Website.
- For the backend part, check this repository: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5.
- Follow the instructions and start the server.
- Check again the page 'index.html' from the front-end repo that you opened previously: now it is working properly.
